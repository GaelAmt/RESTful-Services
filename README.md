# RESTful-Services
API based on Jax-RS and Jersey in Java.
The point of this project was to create a simple REST API, the data are stored locally in the memory using HashMap.
In the future, a database would be mendatory, but it was not the point of this school project to have consitent data.
For the moment, the api returns mostly XML data, but it would be good to also return JSON.

I've used a simple apache server to perform request with POSTMAN.
If you use a web brower, some pages will send html code so it's easier to add data for example.

## Documentation
You can refer to the "Diagramme conceptuel" file to look at the request available.
